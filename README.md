# Hands2017ChallengeCompositionalPoseRegression
Implementation of Compositional Pose Regression for ICCV2017 workshop Hands2017 Challenge.

Note that this is the unofficial implementation for the paper "Compositional Human Pose Regression", and thus the author does not guarantee the 100 percent accuracy.

In case it is beneficial for your research, please cite this wepage.

The author finds it laborious to upload the preprocessed depth data & ground truth & statistics(avg & std), and to write decent comments for the code. Interested readers are encouraged to contact Qingfu Wan directly via strawberryfgalois@gmail.com. Thank you!
